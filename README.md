# Board Game :game_die:

## :large_blue_diamond: In Progress!

In this project, I built a backend for a tic tac toe game.

## Quickstart :rocket:

 1. clone this repo
 2. `yarn compile` or `tsc`
 3. `yarn start` or `yarn dev` or `node .` or `nodemon .`
 4. send an empty `POST` request to /games
 5. happy hacking! :ok_hand:

## Endpoints

* `GET/games` - returns all the games in db
* `POST/games` - saves a game with a 3 x 3 board and a random color
* `PUT/games` - makes a move (still in progress, please be nice :wink: )
